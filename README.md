# USRNN
The USRNN (unsupervised structured illuminated reconstruction neutral network) we propose is a deep learning method that recovering super resolution images with less raw data. In this repository, codes used for super resolution reconstruction , some testing data, the network and corresponding licenses are uploaded.
